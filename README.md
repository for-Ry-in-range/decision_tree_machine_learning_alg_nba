# Decision Tree Machine Learning Algorithm

A decision tree machine learning algorithm and model built from scrath. The ML model predicts if an NBA rookie will last 5 years in the league, based on their rookie year stats.


## Features
- Decision tree algorithm built from scratch (no scikit-learn)
- Core algorithms: entropy, information gain, recursive tree building
- Modular code structure for maintainability
- Achieved 70.6% accuracy
- Feature importance analysis
